# Title: Use Github Issues to Drive Development

## Status: Testing

## Context:

This project is complex by nature, and Agile development is the natural choice, particularly using Scrum.
Also, the point of building software is to provide solutions to problems.

## Decision:

## Consequences:

The GitHub issue system is capable of mimicing the Scrum board of Agile, where each developer
can assign themselves tasks for the day. This method of introducing features would naturally frame features as solutions to problems.
